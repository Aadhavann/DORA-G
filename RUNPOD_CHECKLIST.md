- [ ] Restart training

**W&B Errors:**
- [ ] Check: `wandb status`
- [ ] Re-login: `wandb login --relogin $WANDB_API_KEY`
- [ ] Or continue offline: `export WANDB_MODE=offline`

**Disk Full:**
- [ ] Check space: `df -h`
- [ ] Clear cache if needed: `rm -rf /workspace/cache/`
- [ ] Ensure network volume is mounted
